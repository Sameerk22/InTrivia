# **Intrivia**

### **Introduction**

Intrivia is an interview training platform that aims to train people for an interview. It will be providing a platform where people can train themselves and analyze their progress along with time and attempts. By utilizing the knowledge of Natural Language processing (semantic similarity and topics modeling), we will implement a real-time interview environment that deals in subjective questioning answering. It will allow the registered user to take 3 free attempts to prepare him/her for the interview along with a detailed session report at the end of each test.

The major tasks we will be working on are as follows:

- **Semantic Textual Similarity**
- **Topic Modeling**
- **Web application**

## **Project Vision:**

---

### **Problem Statement:**

Currently there is no platform available on the internet which can help people around the globe to prepare themselves for the interview and score their dream job so our mission is to design an interviewing training system which can prepare people before the actual interview and perform at their best.

### **Business Opportunity:**

As our free version of the software will allow users to attempt the training session for a limited number of times but users can increase this limit by buying our paid subscription package.

### **Objectives:**

Our main Objective is to provide an interview training platform where people can gain knowledge and analyze themselves through mock interviews. At the end of the session a detailed interview session report will be generated which will highlight weak areas of the person and help them improve their presentation skills on the next attempt.

### **Project Scope:**

The project will be developed over a course of 8 months and it will be a web-based application (MERN). User will be asked subjective questions related to a specific topic and their answers will be marked using a trained model based on semantic analysis and NLP techniques. Topic modeling will be used to generate new questions for user and at the end of the session, system will generate a report showing scores and mentioning weak areas of user. User will also be able to record and download his/her video of interview and he/she will be able to listen and answer questions though text-to-speech and speech-to-text feature.
